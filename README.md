Arcade game made from scratch in python using pygame where player moves using arrow keys and shoots with the spacebar. All images and sound effects are takes from pinterest/youtube. Hope you like it.
Create a folder named Assets, add all the images/sounds in it and open that folder along with the main python file in vs code to run the game.
